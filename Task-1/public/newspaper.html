                    <h1>IPL 2022: CSK begin training in Surat, fans queue up on streets to catch a glimpse of MS Dhoni</h1>
                </p>
                <p> Chennai Super Kings are one of the most popular Indian Premier League teams going around and the reception they received in Surat is a testimony to it. Fans queued up on the streets to catch a glimpse of MS Dhoni and CSK stars as the defending
                    champions began their training in the West Indian state of Gujarat.</p>
                <p> In a video shared by Chennai Super Kings, MS Dhoni can be seen walking into the stadium for their training session at Surat amid much fanfare. The team bus, the trademark one in yellow, was flocked by fans as they headed to the stadium
                    from the team hotel. A fan was even spotted with the Chennai Super Kings jersey on the streets. "Those eyes that smile with love give us the joy, everywhere we go!" CSK wrote while sharing the video of fans cheering the team in Surat.</p>

                <p>Left-arm wrist spinner Kuldeep Yadav has been released from India's Test squad for the 2nd match of the ongoing series against Sri Lanka, starting March 10. Kuldeep was named in the 18-man squad but he did not make it to the playing XI
                    in the first Test in Mohali despite India playing 3 spinners.</p>
                <p>Kuldeep Yadav was added to the Test squad along with Bihar left-arm spinner Saurabh Kumar after Axar Patel was not available due to a shin injury that also kept him out of the limited-overs series against Sri Lanka and the West Indies
                    and the entire tour of South Africa. However, Axar Patel has regained full fitness and is likely to be added to the Test squad for the pink-ball fixture against Sri Lanka, BCCI sources said. Axar Patel last played against New Zealand
                    at home last year. He picked up 9 wickets across 2 matches against the Black Caps before he picked up the injury. It will be interesting to see if Axar will get a game in Bengaluru as India and Sri Lanka will look to make use of the
                    conditions in the pink-ball Test. With R Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja certain to start, India might look to beef up the pace attack for the 2nd Test.</p>

                    <h1>BCB president questions Shakib's commitment to national team</h1>
                    The Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hasan on Monday (March 7) raised questions over Shakib Al Hasan's commitment to the national side after he announced that he is mentally and physically exhausted and not ready to play in the upcoming tour
                    of South Africa.</p>

                <p> The BCB included Shakib in their squad for the tour of South Africa after he agreed to play in the series consisting of three ODIs and two Tests, though initially he refused to play the Test series as he wanted to make himself available
                    for the Indian Premier League.</p>

                <p> However none of the franchises were interested in picking him which paved the way for him to make himself available for the entire tour. However, there was a late twist in the tale as he announced on Sunday that constant cricket is weighing
                    him down.</p>

                    <h1>Hardik to attend camp in B'lore for white-ball specialists</h1>
                </p>
                <p>The camp has been called keeping the October T20 World Cup in mind, with Indian coach Rahul Dravid and selectors driving the process. Â© BCCI Hardik Pandya, out of action since the T20 World Cup last October, has not been given up on by
                    the Indian team think tank and the star-all-rounder has been called for the camp underway at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore from March 5. Cricbuzz understands that the 28-year-old Baroda cricketer, named skipper by
                    the new Gujarat Titans franchise recently, has sought time to join the camp. He is expected to be part of it in a couple of days. His brother Krunal Pandya, also an all-rounder, however, has not been asked to report.
                </p>

                <p> Cricbuzz reported about the Bangalore gathering recently and it has since emerged that the camp has, in fact, been called keeping the October T20 World Cup in mind, with Indian coach Rahul Dravid and selectors driving the process. The
                    player assembly, for about 25 of them, apparently, has only been for the white-ball specialists.
                </p>

                <p> "Although the World Cup is more than six months away, planning can start now. The coaches and selectors want to assess the fitness of the players and take stock of things for the big event," said source in the know of developments. Pandya's
                    presence, in that context, is seen as an indicator that he is in the scheme of the Indian team management and could be in contention for a berth in the World Cup squad. This website learns that he is likely to be tried out in the home
                    T20 series against South Africa in June, if the injury-prone player survives the wear and tear of the IPL.</p>


                <p> Pandya last played for India on November 8, against Namibia, amid question marks over his fitness and inability to do all-round duties, bowling in particular. Pandya did bowl a few overs in the World Cup, although not with usual flourish
                    and effectiveness. Multiple sources within the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have confirmed that the all-rounder will attend the camp. Pandya did not respond to a text message.

                <p> Franchises unhappy over Bangalore camp</p>

                <p> Meanwhile, the 10-day camp has led to a sort of polarisation among the various stakeholders of Indian cricket with some Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises expressing reservation over it before BCCI/IPL officials. Their grievance is,
                    mainly, for lack of access to the players ahead of the season.</p>

                <p> Franchise and BCCI sources have confirmed to Cricbuzz over discussion about the camp with the former claiming that they are being denied their contractual right to have access to the players two weeks prior to the start of the league.
                    This website can confirm that the franchises have taken up the matter with IPL chairman Brijesh Patel and CEO Hemang Amin.</p>

                </p> With IPL set to start on March 26, the franchises would have preferred to have the players by March 12 so that they can engage them in promotional, team building, team boding and strategic pre-tournament activities. In that context, they
                have also pointed out to the BCCI/IPL that after the camp ends on March 15, the players have to undergo three-day quarantine and can join the teams only around March 18, just about a week before the start of the league. Finally, the parties
                seem to have reached some kind of consensus that the last five days of the camp will be in a controlled bio-secure bubble environment so that the players can be transported to their respective IPL teams through a bubble-to-bubble transfer.
                Messages to Dravid, BCCI office-bearers and selection committee chairman Chetan Sharma did not elicit immediate replies.</p>
